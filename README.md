# ReorderableDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.2.

The component itself is an abbreviated replica of one I had built for a video streaming client, which allows a business representative to reorder channels as they would appear on an application ribbon. When built, it replaced a bureaucratic process that involved business representatives, engineers and several days of painful reinterpretation. I am quite proud of it.

You should be able to:
* Select channels (try Ctrl and Shift selects)
* Drag and drop channels to reorder them
* Search for channels using the field at the top.




## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
